Nada thanked the caller and hung up, her mind racing with possibilities. These tips were commonâ€”red herrings designed to keep the case alive. But this time, she felt an unsettling certainty that it might be different.

"Hold on a second," Hermione replied, her tone hinting at excitement. "I think I might have something interesting too."

Nada listened as Hermione described an old newspaper clipping she had come across, detailing the first murder scene of Alex's reign. The article spoke of a young woman found dead in an alleyway, but there were no fingerprints or DNA left
