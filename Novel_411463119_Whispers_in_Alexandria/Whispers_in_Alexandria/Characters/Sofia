Sofia, known as the "Echoes of Silence," is not as widely recognized as Alex or Ptolemy, but her crimes have left their mark on the city in a subtle yet haunting way.

These notes hinted at themes of isolation, despair, and the struggle within human souls. The common thread linking these murders was always a victim who had managed to escape their own silence, only for Sofia to snatch them back.
