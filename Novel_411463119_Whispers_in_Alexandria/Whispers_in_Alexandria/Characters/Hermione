In the sprawling, ancient city of Alexandria, where the whispers of history mingle with the echoes of modern life, there is another voice that adds to the city’s haunting symphony. Hermione, a young and ambitious journalist, has come from Cairo to uncover the truth behind the "Serial Killer of Egypt." Her presence in the city is marked by a determined gaze and a notebook filled with questions.

Hermione's journey begins when she stumbles upon an old newspaper clipping about Alex’s first case—a story that had been buried beneath layers of dust, almost forgotten. Intrigued by the eerie parallels between the article and recent events, Hermione delves deeper into the city’s past, piecing together a narrative that intertwines history with current crime.

As she interviews Detective Nada Hassan, Hermione learns about the relentless pursuit to solve these cases and the elusive figure known as Alex. Together, they navigate through the labyrinthine streets of Alexandria, following leads that take them from grand museums to hidden alleys. Each conversation with residents adds a new layer to the puzzle, but the answers Hermione seeks seem ever out of reach.

Hermione’s investigative skills are put to the test when she uncovers a series of cryptic messages left by Alex at crime scenes—messages that hint at deeper meanings and connections. These clues lead her not only closer to solving the crimes but also to understanding Alex's motives, which delve into themes of identity, power, and control.
