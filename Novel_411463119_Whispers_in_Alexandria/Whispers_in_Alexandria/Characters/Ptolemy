# Begin Ptolemy.md

In the sprawling, ancient city of Alexandria, where history whispers through every stone and modern life echoes its rhythms, there exists a figure whose name is whispered in awe and fear—Ptolemy. Known as the "Philosopher's Avenger," Ptolemy's identity remains shrouded in mystery, much like Alex or Hermione. His crimes are not those of a serial killer but rather acts of vengeance born from a deep-seated philosophical belief.

Ptolemy first made his presence known nearly two centuries ago during the height of Alexandria’s intellectual heyday. The murder was as meticulously planned as any of Alex's, but with a twist. Unlike Alex, who left no fingerprints behind, Ptolemy inscribed cryptic messages on the walls and in books, hinting at his philosophical motivations.

The victim that night was none other than a prominent philosopher known for his radical ideas challenging the status quo. The crime scene was staged to look like an ordinary argument gone wrong, but every detail pointed to something far more complex—a struggle between opposing philosophies.

Over time, Ptolemy's modus operandi evolved in much the same way as Alex’s. Each murder became a philosophical discourse inscribed on the flesh of his victims. The common thread linking these murders was always a figure or idea that Ptolemy deemed an enemy to true wisdom and enlightenment.
