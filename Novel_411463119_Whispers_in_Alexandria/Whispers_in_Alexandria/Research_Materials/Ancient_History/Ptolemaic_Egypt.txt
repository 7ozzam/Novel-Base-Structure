## Prologue: The Shadows of Ptolemaic Times

In the ancient and enigmatic city of Alexandria, under the vast expanse of the Mediterranean sky, lurks a shadow that has cast its dark presence across centuries. This is the story of Ptolemy, known as the "Philosopher's Avenger," who operates in the shadows of history with a purpose far beyond mere murder.

### Chapter 1: The Fall of Knowledge

Ptolemaic Egypt was a beacon of intellectual enlightenment, where philosophers and scholars from across the world gathered to exchange ideas and challenge each other. In this hub of knowledge, Ptolemy first made his presence known nearly two centuries ago. The fall of knowledge in Alexandria under Roman rule was the catalyst that triggered Ptolemy’s wrath.

One fateful night, a prominent philosopher named Arisopolis delivered a speech challenging the established philosophical norms. His radical ideas threatened not just the status quo but the very fabric of society. That night, Arisopolis was found dead in his study, his body surrounded by cryptic inscriptions that hinted at a deeper philosophical discourse.

Ptolemy’s first murder was meticulously planned to look like an ordinary argument gone wrong. But every detail pointed to something far more complex—a struggle between opposing philosophies. The crime scene was left with a single inscription: "Wisdom is the key, but truth is the ultimate goal."
