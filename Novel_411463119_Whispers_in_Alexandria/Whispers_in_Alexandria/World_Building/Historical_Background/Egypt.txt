## Prologue: Whispers in Stone and Shadows

The ancient city of Alexandria, where history whispers through every stone and modern life echoes its rhythms, has long been a stage for unspeakable acts. At the heart of this enigma lies the figure known as "Serial Killer of Egypt"—a name that strikes fear into the hearts of residents and investigators alike.

Alex's first appearance was like a shadow in the night, his presence announced by a chilling whisper that reverberated through the bustling streets. A young woman lay sprawled on cold stone, her life extinguished without a trace of evidence pointing to an identity. In those early days, even the city’s oldest inhabitants could not recall such a crime, leaving only a trail of unanswered questions.

Over the years, Alex's modus operandi evolved into something more intricate and sophisticated. Each meticulously planned murder left no fingerprints behind but instead a trail of cryptic messages, taunting those who sought to understand his motives. His victims were chosen with a precision that bordered on obsession—each one linked by their connection to the city’s intellectual community.

Detective Nada Hassan has dedicated her career to solving these cases. Her office in the police station is filled with files and evidence, each one more perplexing than the last. Despite her expertise, every step closer she takes seems to only deepen the mystery.

In Whispers in Alexandria, Alex becomes a symbol not just of fear but of the unyielding human psyche.
