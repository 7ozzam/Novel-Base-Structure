### **Timeline 3: The First Leap (March 2060)**

**Overview**  
Timeline 3 details the first series of leaps through the wormhole, beginning with an experimental leap of a drone and followed by Dr. Emily Carter’s own leap. The team begins to realize the implications of their actions as they begin to explore different times and alternate realities. Tensions rise, and unexplainable phenomena start to manifest, challenging their understanding of time and reality.

#### **March 2, 2060: The First Successful Leap – Sending the Drone**

**Key Event**: The team successfully conducts the first controlled leap through the wormhole, sending a drone through an established route to a point in the past. The drone returns with an artifact from an earlier time, marking the first concrete proof of the wormhole’s ability to travel through time and alternate realities.
  
- **Relevant Characters**:
  - **Dr. Emily Carter**: Emily oversees the test, feeling a mix of excitement and trepidation. She’s eager to prove the device’s capabilities but remains cautious of the unknown consequences.
  - **Dr. Marcus Thompson**: Thompson remains deeply cautious and offers a voice of reason, worried that sending the drone could have unforeseen consequences. He insists on extensive analysis before attempting any human leaps.
  - **Dr. Sophia Chen**: Sophia, although still skeptical of the ethics, is fascinated by the results. She wonders about the philosophical implications of retrieving objects from the past and their effect on history.
  - **Dr. Alan Rivera**: Rivera is thrilled by the success of the drone leap and eagerly prepares for further experiments. He is keen on pushing the boundaries of what they’ve just discovered.
  - **Agent Jack Reeves**: Reeves is present for the drone’s leap and is astonished by the results. His skepticism starts to wane as he begins to see the potential military and strategic uses for this technology.

#### **March 5, 2060: Dr. Emily Carter’s First Human Leap**

**Key Event**: Emily volunteers to be the first human to leap through the wormhole. She jumps to a nearby point in time, only a few days in the past. Upon returning, Emily experiences memory distortions and a sense of disorientation. Though the leap is successful, she begins to realize that tampering with time may have unforeseen effects on her own perception of reality.
  
- **Relevant Characters**:
  - **Dr. Emily Carter**: Emily is the first to take the leap, an act of courage and scientific curiosity. Upon returning, she experiences memory gaps, leaving her unsettled and questioning the consequences of further leaps.
  - **Dr. Marcus Thompson**: Thompson is initially reluctant to allow Emily to jump but supports her decision. He is concerned about her well-being after the memory distortion, raising alarms about the dangers of human leaps.
  - **Dr. Sophia Chen**: Sophia is worried about Emily’s decision, advocating for caution and raising concerns about the potential mental and emotional consequences of leaping through time. Her fears become more evident as Emily’s disorientation grows.
  - **Dr. Alan Rivera**: Rivera is eager for further experimentation, downplaying the significance of Emily’s disorientation. He believes that the team can work through any side effects with time.
  - **Agent Jack Reeves**: Reeves, now convinced of the technology’s potential, remains focused on practical applications, especially for government and military interests. However, he begins to worry about the safety of the team, particularly Emily’s well-being.

#### **March 10, 2060: The Manifestation of Unexplainable Phenomena**

**Key Event**: After the first human leap, the team begins to notice unexplainable phenomena occurring within the lab. Objects appear out of nowhere, and time perception begins to distort. These events are linked to the team's leaps, suggesting that their interventions in time are causing ripples across the fabric of reality.
  
- **Relevant Characters**:
  - **Dr. Emily Carter**: Emily starts to experience fleeting memories of events that never occurred. She wonders if the distortions are connected to her leap or if they are a consequence of something more sinister.
  - **Dr. Marcus Thompson**: Thompson is alarmed by the disturbances and begins to suspect that their actions are destabilizing the timeline. He pushes for a pause in the experiments to analyze these anomalies further.
  - **Dr. Sophia Chen**: Sophia is terrified by the distortions, fearing they are the result of tampering with the very fabric of time. She argues for an immediate cessation of all experiments, questioning whether the team should abandon the project entirely.
  - **Dr. Alan Rivera**: Rivera, still excited by the prospects of their experiments, dismisses the anomalies as temporary glitches. He is reluctant to stop and suggests further testing to understand the phenomena.
  - **Agent Jack Reeves**: Reeves grows more concerned, recognizing the potential for catastrophic consequences. He urges the team to focus on practical applications, hoping to contain the disturbances for military purposes but becomes increasingly concerned about their safety.

#### **March 15, 2060: Targeted Leaps Begin – Ancient Egypt and Renaissance Italy**

**Key Event**: The team begins to conduct targeted leaps to specific historical periods to retrieve knowledge or artifacts. Their first destinations are **Ancient Egypt (circa 2500 BCE)** and **Renaissance Italy (circa 1500 CE)**. The team’s interactions with these historical periods result in the discovery of significant artifacts: in Egypt, they find an ancient blueprint that resembles the design of their quantum device; in Italy, they influence Leonardo da Vinci’s inventions, inadvertently inspiring him to sketch a design strikingly similar to the quantum device.
  
- **Relevant Characters**:
  - **Dr. Emily Carter**: Emily leads the leap into Ancient Egypt, eager to uncover new insights that could validate her work. She is fascinated by the ancient blueprint but begins to feel uneasy about the consequences of their interactions.
  - **Dr. Marcus Thompson**: Thompson is wary of the team’s growing influence on history, fearing that their interventions could irreparably alter the past. However, he continues to support Emily in the quest for knowledge.
  - **Dr. Sophia Chen**: Sophia is troubled by the influence the team has had on history, particularly in Italy. She begins to see the team’s actions as irresponsible, advocating for a halt to further jumps to avoid corrupting the timeline.
  - **Dr. Alan Rivera**: Rivera is thrilled by the discoveries, particularly in Renaissance Italy. He feels that their contributions to history are justified, even if they have caused some unexpected changes.
  - **Agent Jack Reeves**: Reeves grows increasingly focused on the political and military implications of these discoveries, seeing potential for global leverage. He insists on continuing the jumps, convinced of their strategic value.

#### **March 20, 2060: The Team Discovers the Risks of Their Actions**

**Key Event**: The team begins to realize the long-term risks of their repeated interventions in the past. The fabric of time appears to be destabilizing, and the team is forced to confront the unintended consequences of their actions. Historical timelines begin to show subtle changes, and the team worries about the irreversible damage they may have caused.

- **Relevant Characters**:
  - **Dr. Emily Carter**: Emily feels the burden of responsibility weighing heavily on her. She realizes that their actions could have far-reaching consequences that they are not equipped to manage.
  - **Dr. Marcus Thompson**: Thompson insists that the team halt all further experiments, warning that they are on the brink of a disaster. He is fearful that they’ve already set in motion events they cannot control.
  - **Dr. Sophia Chen**: Sophia’s concerns grow as she sees the effects of their interventions spreading. She urges the team to stop, fearing that they may have already doomed their timeline.
  - **Dr. Alan Rivera**: Rivera is reluctant to stop the experiments, arguing that they must continue exploring the potential of the wormhole. He is in denial about the risks, focusing solely on the scientific breakthroughs.
  - **Agent Jack Reeves**: Reeves is caught between his duty to the government and his growing awareness that their actions may have put everyone at risk. He begins to question whether the military applications of the technology are worth the price they might have to pay.
